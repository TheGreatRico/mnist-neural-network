# MNIST label prediction with Neural Network

A simple Neural Network built without libraries to predict labels of MNIST digits images and Fashion MNIST clothes labels from images.

A more detailed description of the neural network architecture can be found in [this file](architecture.ipynb "architecture notebook").

**The main goal** of this project was to *gain an insight* into neural networks and *hands-on experience* by creating a working model.
